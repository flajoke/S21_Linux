## Reset the SSHd service to port 2022.
## Show the presence of the sshd process using the ps command. To do this, you need to match the keys to the command.

## Reboot the system.
- Describe in the report what you have done to complete all five points (you can do this in text or with screenshots).

![task81](./screenshots/task81.png)

## Resetting SSHd to the 2022 port:
![task82](./screenshots/task82.png)

## Using ps and grep for search proccess of SSHd
![task83](./screenshots/task83.png)

## Reboot the system:
![task84](./screenshots/task84.png)

## Keys which I used for search:
##### -t (--tcp) --- show just TCP ports
##### -a (--all) --- show condition all sokets
##### -n (--numeric) --- show addresses as numbers

## All columns:

##### Proto is the protocol used by the socket. Since the [-t | --tcp] option was used, only TCP sockets are present in the output.
##### Recv-Q is a counter of bytes not copied by the user's program from this socket.
##### Send-Q is a counter of bytes not confirmed by the remote node.
##### Local Address - the address and port number of the local end of the socket. If the [-n | --numeric] option is specified, output in the format [socket address:port number], otherwise - [canonical node name:corresponding service name]. In the line we are interested in, # 0.0.0.0 is the address of the local end of the socket, 2022 is the port number, which we changed from 22 to 2022. Address 0.0.0.0 means that the remote end of the socket will be accessible to all local ip addresses.
##### Foreign Address - the address and port number of the remote end of the socket.
##### State - the state of the socket. The LISTEN state means that the socket is waiting for incoming connections.
